Of course. Here's a feature list for your attendance app, incorporating your requests and adding some logical extensions for a more complete and user-friendly experience.

---

### **Core Features**

This list is broken down into logical modules, from initial setup to daily use and reporting.

---

### **1. Student & Class Management (Setup)** üìö

This module focuses on getting the necessary student and class data into the app.

* **Student Data Import:**
    * Import a list of students from a **.csv** or **.json** file.
    * The app should provide a clear template or instructions on the required format (e.g., columns for `roll_no`, `student_name`).
* **Manual Student Management (CRUD):**
    * Ability to **Add**, **View**, **Edit**, and **Delete** individual students manually for quick corrections without needing to re-import the entire list.
* **Class Structure Setup:**
    * A settings area to define and manage **Departments** (e.g., Computer, Mechanical).
    * Ability to add and manage **Years** (e.g., 1st Year, 2nd Year).
    * Functionality to create and name **Divisions** within each year (e.g., A, B, C).

### **2. Attendance Marking (Daily Workflow)** ‚úÖ

This is the main screen faculty will use daily. The workflow should be as fast and efficient as possible.

* **Session Selector:**
    * Before taking attendance, the user must select the **Department**, **Year**, and **Division** from simple dropdown menus.
* **Lecture Selector:**
    * A dropdown to select the lecture for the current session (e.g., "Maths", "Physics Lab"). The list of lectures should be customizable.
* **Smart Text-Based Input:**
    * A primary text input field for quickly marking students.
    * The app will accept **comma-separated** or **space-separated** roll numbers (e.g., "5, 12, 34" or "5 12 34").
    * A toggle or button to switch the mode:
        * **Mark as Absent (Default):** Numbers entered are marked as absent.
        * **Mark as Present:** Numbers entered are marked as present (useful for seminars or events with low attendance).
* **Visual Attendance List:**
    * Display a full list of students for the selected class.
    * Each student's entry will show their roll number, name, and current attendance status (e.g., a green 'P' for Present, red 'A' for Absent).
    * Allow faculty to **tap on any student** in the list to manually toggle their status for easy corrections.
* **Real-time Summary:**
    * A live counter at the top or bottom of the screen showing the total number of **Present** vs. **Absent** students.

### **3. Reporting & Communication** üì§

This module focuses on generating and sharing attendance data.

* **Daily Absentee Report:**
    * A dedicated section to view a consolidated list of all students who were absent for **at least one lecture** during the day.
* **One-Click Sharing:**
    * **Email to Counselor:** A "Share" button that opens the user's default email app. The email will be pre-filled with the counselor's address, a subject line (e.g., "Absentee Report for [Date]"), and the formatted list of absent students.
    * **WhatsApp to Parents Group:** A "Share" button that opens WhatsApp with a pre-formatted message containing the daily absentee list, ready to be sent to the designated parents' group.
* **Attendance History:**
    * View past attendance records by date.
    * Ability to edit past records to correct any mistakes.
* **Export Data:**
    * Option to export attendance reports for a specific date range (e.g., weekly, monthly) as a `.csv` file.

### **4. Settings & Customization** ‚öôÔ∏è

This module allows users to tailor the app to their specific needs.

* **Manage Lectures:**
    * A dedicated settings screen to **Add**, **Edit**, or **Delete** custom lecture names. This list will populate the "Lecture Selector" dropdown.
* **Configure Contacts:**
    * A field to save the **Class Counselor's email address**.
    * A field to store information for the **Parents' WhatsApp group** to make sharing seamless.
* **Data Backup & Restore:**
    * An option to export the entire app database to a single file for backup.
    * An option to restore the data from a previously exported file. This is crucial for an app with no cloud sync.
